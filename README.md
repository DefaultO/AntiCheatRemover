# AntiCheatRemover

Realms of the Mad God uses Anti-Cheat Toolkit (ACTk) for their speedhack detection. Since there seem to be no anti-measures implemented against simply unloading the ACTk. We might as well just do that.

This allows you to speedhack in the game -> making the game around 1.15 times faster using something like Cheat Engine. Going higher might be possible if your ping is high, but can and will result in a game kick (this game doesn't seem to like to ban cheaters).
