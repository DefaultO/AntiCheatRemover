### About
Realms of the Mad God uses [Anti-Cheat Toolkit (ACTk)](https://codestage.net/uas/actk/) for their client-sided speedhack detection. Since there seems to be no anti-measures implemented against simply unloading the ACTk. We might as well just do that.

This [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader) mod allows you to speedhack in the game. It isn't much, but you can make the game run around 1.15 times (15%) faster using something like Cheat Engine, which is a nice DEX/walkspeed boost. Going higher is possible when your ping is high, but can and will result in a game kick (this game doesn't seem to like banning cheaters, instead, they only react if there is a support case, like claiming the gold from an [in-game item](https://www.realmeye.com/wiki/secret-hoard) or recovering an account).
